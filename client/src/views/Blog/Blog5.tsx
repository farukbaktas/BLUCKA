                            <p className=''>The nature of liquidity in currency is simple: the higher the liquidity, the easier it is to trade without substantially affecting overall market price of the currency. Conversely, the lower the liquidity, limited supply can make prices more susceptible to spiking or crashing. How can liquidity redefine the future of money and how does liquidity prove the authenticity of a currency? <a className='underline text-gray-200' href="https://www.forex.com/ie/markets-to-trade/cryptocurrency-trading/cryptocurrency-market-hours/#:~:text=Are%20crypto%20markets%20always%20open,a%20decentralised%20network%20of%20computers.">The 24/7 nature of the cryptocurrency market</a>, <a className='underline text-gray-200' href="https://www.fintechnews.org/the-use-of-cryptocurrency-in-international-trade-and-cross-border-transactions/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20there%20is%20no,such%20as%20foreign%20exchange%20rates)."> ease of trading internationally</a>, <a className='underline text-gray-200' href="https://philippsandner.medium.com/the-impact-of-crypto-currencies-on-developing-countries-dce44c529d6b"> ease of transcending country’s economic woes</a> in addition to the sheer amount of bitcoin directly correlates to why liquidity indicates the currency is here to stay.  </p>

                            <p className='mb-3'>Will the wider adoption of more alternative digital currencies result in a mass adoption of cryptocurrency, where social cohesion and disestablishment of banks see an upsurge of decentralized dominance? Or will the pendulum swing the other way and redefine cryptocurrency as a way for government financial inclusion as a way to metamorphosize traditional banking into the digital realm? <a className='underline text-gray-200' href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-us-bitcoin-etf-is-game-changer-crypto-2024-01-10/"> With the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving exchange-traded funds (ETFs) whose purpose is track price of Bitcoin over time - indicate the former.</a> This is a huge win not only for the cryptocurrency market as a whole, but as a legitimization of the crypto on the world financial stage.</p>
